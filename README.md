# grunt-blogbuilder

A Grunt task for generating a static blog

## Getting Started

To install `grunt-blogbuilder`, you need to first install Node.js - I recommend using NVM to do this. You will also need the `grunt-cli` module to be installed globally. Then run the following command:

```bash
npm install grunt-blogbuilder
```
